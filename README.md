Developer Document: OpenWeatherMap API and Flutter
App Idea
The weather app displays the current weather and forecast for a user's location or any other location of their choosing. Users can search for a location by name or use their device's GPS to automatically detect their location. The app will display information such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, and weather conditions for the current day, as well as a five-day forecast. The app will also display graphics and animations to represent current weather conditions.

Challenges Faced
The OpenWeatherMap API can be complex and require parsing of JSON responses. Accurately detecting the user's location using GPS can be challenging, particularly in areas with poor reception. Ensuring the app is fast and responsive when making API requests and parsing responses.

Approach to Development
We will use the Flutter framework to develop the app, as it allows for quick and easy development of mobile apps. We will use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for the app. We will use the geolocator package to detect the user's location using GPS. We will use the flutter_spinkit package to display loading spinners while making API requests. We will use the weather icons package to display weather conditions using appropriate icons and graphics. We will follow best practices for code structure and documentation to ensure our code is easy to read and understand.

Project Structure
1. "main.dart": The entry point for the app.
2. "app.dart": The root widget for the app.
3. "screens/home_screen.dart": The home screen which displays the current weather and forecast.
4. "screens/loading_screen.dart": The loading screen which is displayed while the app retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
5. "screens/location_screen.dart": The location screen which allows users to search for a location by name or use their device's GPS to automatically detect their location.
6. "widgets/city_input.dart": A reusable widget for entering a city name for location search.
7. "widgets/gradient_container.dart": A reusable widget for displaying a gradient background.
8. "widgets/location_card.dart": A reusable widget for displaying the user's current location.
9. "widgets/weather_card.dart": A reusable widget for displaying weather information.
10. "models/weather.dart": A class to represent the weather data returned by the OpenWeatherMap API.
11. "providers/weather_provider.dart": A class to handle state management and API requests for weather data.
12. "services/weather_service.dart": A class to handle API requests for weather data.
13. "utils/constants.dart": A file containing constants used throughout the app.
14. "pubspec.yaml": The file that lists the dependencies for the app.
By following this project structure, we can ensure that our code is organized and easy to maintain. It also allows for easier collaboration with other developers who may join the project in the future.
